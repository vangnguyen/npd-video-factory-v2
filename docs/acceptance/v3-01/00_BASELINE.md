# V3-01 baseline

Captured at `2026-08-27T12:02:08Z` (`2026-08-27 19:02:08 Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`).
Governance state updated after bounded G-00 approval at `2026-08-27T13:29:26Z`.

## Control state

```text
FEATURE FREEZE: ACTIVE
DEFAULT VERDICT: NO-GO UNTIL PROVEN
CURRENT RC: not yet established
AUDIT BASE SHA: cae40eda871d0f9c7fc315229361a40032d48967
CURRENT SAFE PHASE: remediation development in LOCAL/CI; draft PRs only
G-00: APPROVED by V3-01-APP-001
NEXT OWNER GATE: G-08 for each remediation PR merge
NO MERGE / NO DEPLOY / NO PUBLISH WITHOUT EXPLICIT OWNER APPROVAL
```

G-00 accepts the feature freeze, matrix, gaps and remediation sequence. It does not authorize a
merge, deployment, public ingress, credential use, provider execution, spend, external publish,
analytics write or takedown. Those actions remain bound to their separate gates.

The V3-01 source supplied by the owner is document `NPD-VF-V3-01`, version `3.01.0`, SHA-256
`53160020d5d32a5327857c899f3a7cb3cdd2d1292d98e6ec51ba97239cb4fee4`. The source file is
outside the repository; this record stores only its identifier and hash, not an uncontrolled copy.

## Repository and GitHub

| Field | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `https://github.com/vangnguyen/npd-video-factory-v2.git` |
| Working tree | `C:\Users\VANG NGUYEN\Documents\Codex\2026-08-20\referenced-chatgpt-conversation-this-is-an\work\npd-video-factory-v2` |
| Baseline branch | `main` |
| Audit branch | `audit/v3-01-00-baseline-evidence` |
| Base/HEAD at audit start | `cae40eda871d0f9c7fc315229361a40032d48967` |
| Base commit time | `2026-08-27T10:17:38Z` |
| Open PRs at capture | none |
| Tags/releases | none returned by Git/GitHub |
| Main branch protection | disabled; GitHub API returned `Branch not protected` |
| Latest main CI | [Video Factory V2 CI run 33062401432](https://github.com/vangnguyen/npd-video-factory-v2/actions/runs/33062401432), success |
| Required checks observed | Python, renderer, Studio, safety/Compose, Docker deterministic E2E |
| Working tree at capture | clean before the audit branch was created |

No `AGENTS.md` file exists in the repository. Repository instructions are therefore the checked-in
README, architecture, security, deployment, testing, V2 acceptance and runbook documents.

## Product and schema baseline

| Field | Verified value |
|---|---|
| API/worker/renderer/Studio version | `0.12.0` |
| API title | `NPD Video Factory V2 API` |
| Latest Alembic migration | `0010_v2_11_agent_hub_bridge` |
| Compose project | `npd-video-factory-v2` |
| Default services | PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, migrate, API, Studio, renderer, worker |
| Optional service | `comfyui-bridge` behind disabled `gpu` profile |
| Canonical metadata | V2-owned PostgreSQL |
| Transient delivery/replay | V2-owned Redis |
| Binary objects | MinIO in local/CI; S3-compatible contract for production |
| API/Studio/renderer exposure | localhost by default |

## Runtime evidence

The successful main CI used Python `3.12` and Node `22`. The local audit host exposes the bundled
Python `3.12.13`, bundled Node `24.19.0`, Docker Engine/Client `29.5.3` and Docker Compose `5.1.4`.
Host FFmpeg/FFprobe and a global Node/npm command are not installed; deterministic media execution
runs inside the pinned containers. The host operating system is Windows NT `10.0.26220.0`.

## Deployment baseline

| Field | State |
|---|---|
| Production deployment | no live deployment evidence; repository docs explicitly say not approved/deployed |
| Production commit/image digest | unavailable |
| Production ingress/TLS/Caddy route | absent by design |
| Production database/storage | not provisioned or evidenced |
| Latest production backup | none evidenced |
| Restore/rollback drill | not performed |
| Production incident | none applicable because V2 is not deployed |

This audit does not infer any Video Factory deployment from the separate Agent Hub/SaleHub VPS.

## Provider/configuration baseline

Only variable names and safe policy values were inspected. The ignored local `.env` was not printed,
hashed or copied. It is a development configuration with fixtures and publishing disabled; it is
not production evidence. Credential presence is not permission to call a provider.

Current checked-in production override deliberately selects contract-only or disabled providers:

- trend, Auto Edit, Vision, media and analytics fixtures: false;
- transcription, Vision, stock, image generation, video generation and TTS: `contract`;
- external audio/media/paid media/ComfyUI/analytics execution: false;
- scheduled analytics refresh: false;
- `PUBLISH_ENABLED=false`;
- `PUBLISH_EXTERNAL_EXECUTION_ENABLED=false`;
- `PUBLISH_OWNER_GATE_ENABLED=false`;
- `HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true`;
- Agent Hub bridge and HTTP webhook delivery: disabled unless separately configured.

## Known state at freeze

- CI proves deterministic/local behavior only.
- Interactive Studio/API SSO, RBAC and workspace membership are not implemented/accepted.
- Real providers, real production path, human quality acceptance and public publishing are unproven.
- No external cost was incurred during baseline capture.
- No production write, deploy, publish, credential rotation or provider call was performed.

Evidence: `EV-V3-BASE-001`, `EV-V3-STATIC-001`, `EV-V3-CI-001`, `EV-V3-SAFETY-001`,
`EV-V3-DR-001`.
