# V3-01 implementation inventory

This inventory is a static and deterministic-test audit on base commit
`cae40eda871d0f9c7fc315229361a40032d48967`. It does not establish real-provider,
production-path or human-quality acceptance.

V3-01-01 is merged at exact `main` `9b66d6917d6d58fea995b3a1049fc95198e81bf1`.
The V3-01-02 provider-safety code checkpoint is
`062959287497a5999999adccb65602b88c04947e`; entries below that mention the provider safety
plane describe local/CI remediation only, not production.

| Rights/provenance | asset/media models, full provider rights hook, artifact/storage receipt verification | provider safety, media and publishing fixture tests | Schema/hook implemented; real rights unaccepted |
| Backup/restore | `v2-11-backup.sh`, `v2-11-restore.sh` | syntax/config only | No drill |

## Runtime ownership

The Compose project contains only V2-owned PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, API, Studio, renderer and
worker. The optional ComfyUI bridge is off by default. No Agent Hub, n8n, Caddy, CRM or shared
Redis/database service is defined. This boundary must be preserved by every remediation PR.
