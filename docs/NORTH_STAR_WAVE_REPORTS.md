# North Star wave ledger

## Wave 0 — source preservation

WAVE: 0

STATUS: COMPLETE; SOURCE_PRESERVED = YES

HEAD SHA: initial `2ced7bc81f9402368fb22c9e7aca242e740531af`; baseline commit `106af19`.

CAPABILITIES COMPLETED: actual repo identity/divergence inventory; safe branch; GitHub preservation; full-history bundle verification; raw Git/archive CRC verification; 15 accepted artifact SHA256 comparisons/backup.

CAPABILITIES PARTIAL: no new capability acceptance claimed.

TESTS: archive and SHA256 verification; source clean before preservation.

REAL PROVIDER TESTS: none. MOCK TESTS: none.

EVIDENCE: `NORTH_STAR_BASELINE_2026.md`, `north-star/accepted-artifacts.json`; local recovery root `C:\Users\PC\Documents\ChatGPT\Video Factory\recovery\20261007` with manifest, complete commit/ref lists and verified archives.

REGRESSIONS: no source/runtime/database/artifact changes.

EXTERNAL BLOCKERS: none for preservation; original workspace was empty and long-path checkout failed, resolved using `C:\vfns01`.

OWNER ACTION REQUIRED: none. NEXT WAVE: 1.

## Wave 1 — Master Spec audit

WAVE: 1

STATUS: INITIAL AUDIT COMPLETE; verification findings remain explicit.

HEAD SHA: audit based on `2ced7bc81f9402368fb22c9e7aca242e740531af`, report committed separately after baseline.

CAPABILITIES COMPLETED: 64-row matrix, exact gaps/severities/dependencies/waves/acceptance, 90-section crosswalk, 96 source-file fingerprints, live Native UI read-only inspection and closure plan.

CAPABILITIES PARTIAL: 54 requirements; 2 interface-only; 1 mock-only; 1 missing general cache; 1 unverified Docker; 5 executable implementations still require integrated acceptance. These are inspection classifications, not readiness certification.

TESTS: Native **255/255 PASS**, 128.15 seconds using certified venv; Studio **79/79 PASS**, 499.98 ms. Initial wrong-runtime Native run failed with missing dependencies; preserved. Full API collection blocked on three POSIX modules. Windows-compatible API run initially failed largely due inaccessible pre-existing pytest temp directory; isolated-temp rerun in progress.

REAL PROVIDER TESTS: no new calls. MOCK TESTS: Native/Studio unit/HTTP fixture suites; API results pending, not claimed passing.

EVIDENCE: `NORTH_STAR_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`, `north-star/capabilities.json`, `north-star/master-crosswalk.json`, `north-star/source-inventory.json`, `NORTH_STAR_GAP_CLOSURE_PLAN.md`; exact baseline logs under recovery root.

REGRESSIONS: all accepted video hashes unchanged; no live project writes/restarts. Fresh Native and Studio suites pass.

EXTERNAL BLOCKERS: Windows-only host and absent Docker prevent Linux/Docker certification; several real providers have no complete official adapter yet. Credentials are not treated as the sole blocker for interface-only implementation.

OWNER ACTION REQUIRED: none for safe implementation. Phase 10 personal UAT remains pending. NEXT WAVE: 2, then all remaining safe waves.
